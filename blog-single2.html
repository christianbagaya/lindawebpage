          </h2>
          <p>According to this year’s (January 25th - 3rd April) research by Trends and Insights for Africa (TIFA), over
            half of the
            secondary school students have watched pornography. TIFA notes that teenagers resort to the media for
            information on
            sex; internet films and videos ranking first in this. TIFA findings also highlighted that this is as a
            result of lack of
            sex education in schools and taboos surrounding such conversations in households. Thus, these children are
            left to
            navigate the internet for information that they probably cannot deconstruct.

          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/image_7.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
          </p>
          <p>Now, this is Linda’s plight. Linda has very strict and religious parents who do not condone any
            conversation surrounding
            sexual and reproductive health. The first time she got her period it was her aunt (house help) who gave her
            pads and
            later informed her mother of the developments. From then on, Linda always finds a pack of pads in her bed
            monthly, but
            no conversation attached to it. No guidance from the mother on menstrual cycle but only a “don’t play around
            with boys
            from now on!” What does that even mean to a 13-year-old, my dear readers? Linda is left to relying on her
            science class
            knowledge of the menstrual cycle which is also very brief because her phone cannot access the internet
            either.
          </p>
          <p>
            At age 14, Linda’s aunt (her mum’s sister) visits and takes her to a sexual health centre because now she is
            a ‘big
            girl’. Now, mind you Linda has no understanding of what this place is or why they are there. Later, they see
            a doctor
            who silently talks to her aunt and ‘something’ is inserted in her arm. Fast track to 3 years later, at a
            session with
            the guidance counselling panel at Linda’s high school, she gets an understanding of what was inserted in her
            arm; an
            implant. However, at this point she has been facing side effects that she has no explanation of. Linda is
            very sceptical
            of talking to her parents or teachers about this issue because they will fail to believe her. They might
            refuse to
            understand that she was very oblivious when this was done and that it was not consensual.

          </p>
          <p>
            Dear readers, this is a scenario that is not foreign to girls in Kisumu and other parts of Kenya. They live
            their lives
            with so much uncertainty and curiosity that is never quenched. Let me rephrase, it can be quenched but the
            avenues to do
            so are either limited or very hostile to them. This is why Linda-Project came up with a solution that is
            safe, private
            and relevant for girls like Linda to have their questions answered. A platform where they can transfer the
            conversations
            that they have in their heads to a trained professional that will offer guidance, insight and medical
            referrals if need
            be. This platform is called the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). An affordable platform that
            can reach
            girls despite their economic background.
          </p>
          <!-- <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">#2. Creative WordPress Themes</h2> -->
          <p>Luckily, she can find an ear listening twin in our organisation, Linda which means “protect” in Swahili.
            Our mobile
            health counseling service aims to spark conversations on such turbulence situations that young people
            experience. We
            have noticed that many young people, especially girls, do not have a private and secure platform to ask
            questions on
            myths, misinformation, and ignorance regarding sexual reproductive health issues.
